# DenonAVR
Hubitat device handler for non-HEOS Denon receivers.

Verified to work with x2000 and x3300 (the two I have).

This is largely a copy-and-hack of the excellent handler by sdbobrescu, which can be found at https://github.com/sbdobrescu/DenonAVR_OLD
That handler in turn is based on on a previous release by Kristopher Kubicki, which is at https://github.com/KristopherKubicki/device-denon-avr
